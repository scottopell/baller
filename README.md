Baller
---------

Connect the balls and they go away, a new puzzle every day!

Todo items:
- allow backtracking (deselect balls if its the tail ball) (requires keeping
  track of entire selection path in order)
- Making a square with a gap in the middle (ie, a 3x3 square, not a 2x2 square)
  gets rid of all of that color
- Share your high score
- center the game board visually
- Detect when there are no more moves to be made
- ball falling down animation (seems hard)
- animation when square is formed
